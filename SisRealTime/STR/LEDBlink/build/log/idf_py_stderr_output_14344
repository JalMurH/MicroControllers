CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory D:/2023-1/MicroControllers/SisRealTime/STR/LEDBlink/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory d:/2023-1/MicroControllers/SisRealTime/STR/sample_project/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "D:/2023-1/MicroControllers/SisRealTime/STR/LEDBlink/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "D:/2023-1/MicroControllers/SisRealTime/STR/sample_project/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
